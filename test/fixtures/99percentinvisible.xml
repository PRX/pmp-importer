	<itunes:summary>Design is everywhere in our lives, perhaps most importantly in the places where we've just stopped noticing. 99% Invisible (99 Percent Invisible) is a weekly exploration of the process and power of design and architecture. From award winning producer Roman Mars, KALW in San Francisco, and Radiotopia from PRX. Learn more: http://99percentinvisible.org

Awesome people saying nice things:
"Roman Mars lights the radio.  His pieces conjure other worlds, grapple with big ideas, make sound three dimensional.  They are smart and funny and original. The Kitchen Sisters would like to be Presidents of his Fan Club." -The Kitchen Sisters, NPR

"Highly digging 99% Invisible. One of the best podcasts I've bumped into in a while." -Jad Abumrad, Radiolab

"I love the show. It's wonderful. Actually reminded me of why I love radio." -Jonathan Goldstein, CBC's WireTap

"99% Invisible is completely wonderful…entertaining, and beautifully produced.” -Ira Glass, This American Life

It takes up the whole east end of the block, with its red brick cylindrical turrets topped with gleaming silver cones. All the stained glass windows and intricate stonework make the building looks like something out of a fairytale.<br />
This building’s past, however, is not very fairytale-like at all.<br />
When it was built in 1887, this castle was the country’s first hospital devoted solely to the treatment of cancer. In the late 1800s, cancer was known to start as a tumor, but they didn’t know a whole lot beyond that.<br />
In the back of the castle, was a smoke stack that used to lead out from the crematorium. That smokestack was smoking pretty often.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cities, like living things, evolve slowly over time. Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed, and in this process, bits and pieces that get left behind. Vestiges.

Most of the time, these architectural leftovers rust or crumble or get taken down. But other times, these vestiges aren’t removed. They remain in the urban organism.

These urban vestiges first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That&#8217;s when something clicked.<br />
Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object.<br />
People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria:<br />
1. Were they truly, completely useless?<br />
2. Were they regularly maintained?<br />
In 1985 Akasegawa published a book of these collected photographs and writings, in which he coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers. He called them, “Thomassons.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back in October 2011 (see episode #38, true believers!), we broadcast a short excerpt of a radio documentary produced by Peregrine Andrews about faking the sounds of sports on TV broadcasts. It was one of our most popular and provocative programs ever, primarily because people were shocked that any aspect of a sporting event might be faked. Since then, I&#8217;ve received several requests from the audience asking where they can hear the full-length documentary. Well today, my friends, you are in luck.</p>
<p>When we think of the sound of sports on TV or radio, it&#8217;s generally commentary. But sports broadcasts would be nothing without all the sounds that are behind the commentary&#8211; the crowds, the kicks, the thwacks, and the grunts.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Way back in October 2011 (see episode #38, true believers!), we broadcast a short excerpt of a radio documentary produced by Peregrine Andrews about faking the sounds of sports on TV broadcasts. It was one of our most popular and provocative programs ever, primarily because people were shocked that any aspect of a sporting event might be faked. Since then, I've received several requests from the audience asking where they can hear the full-length documentary. Well today, my friends, you are in luck.

When we think of the sound of sports on TV or radio, it's generally commentary. But sports broadcasts would be nothing without all the sounds that are behind the commentary-- the crowds, the kicks, the thwacks, and the grunts.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In just about every movie set in New York City in the 1970s and 80s there&#8217;s an establishing shot with a graffiti-covered subway.<br />
For city officials, train graffiti was a sign that they had lost control. So, starting in the early 70s, mayors of New York vowed to eradicate graffiti. First, Mayor John Lindsey formed the first anti-graffiti task force. He also re-classified graffiti from a nuisance, like littering or loitering, into a crime.<br />
In 1984 David Gunn became President of the New York City Transit Authority.<br />
Systemically, train line by train line, Gunn took the subways off the map for graffiti writers. While they were fixing it, they didn’t allow any graffiti on it. If graffiti artists “bombed” a train car, the MTA pulled it from the system. Even during rush hour.<br />
May 12, 1989 was declared the official day of the city&#8217;s victory over train graffiti.<br />
But of course train graffiti has never stopped.<br />
There is still subway graffiti—it just never leaves the train yards. Artists—many of them from abroad—paint subway cars knowing full well that they will get cleaned before they&#8217;re ever seen by the public.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The westernmost part of Manhattan, between 34th and 39th street, is pretty industrial. There’s a bus depot, a ferry terminal, and a steady stream of cars. But in the late 19th early 20th centuries, this was cow country.<br />
Cows used to be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey, herded across Twelfth Avenue (now the West Side Highway), and brought to this part of town to be made into beef.<br />
You’ve heard of the meat packing district. This was like the meat hacking district. It was nicknamed &#8220;Abattoir Place.&#8221; It was a hive of bone boilers and hide stretchers and lard renderers. There was a disassembly line for every single part of a cow.<br />
As more and more cows were ferried to the slaughterhouses in Manhattan, it became impossible for passing herds to to coexist with Twelfth Avenue traffic. Not only did the number of cows increase, but so too had the number of carriages, and trains, and, eventually, cars. Cows were in the way. There were reports of epic cow jams on Twelfth avenue.<br />
That’s why people invented cow tunnels. Or at least the story of cow tunnels. At one point there might have actually been tunnels made expressly for cows to march underneath Twelfth Avenue to the abattoir. Or people might have just invented this crazy story about cow tunnels because everybody loves a good, vaguely plausible urban myth.<br />
We have tunnels for cars, for subways, electrical cables, and the internet. Could there be subterranean infrastructure for cows, too?</p>

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is the nation&#8217;s only permanent underground repository for nuclear waste. Eventually, WIPP will be sealed up and left alone. Years will pass and those years will become decades. Those decades will become centuries and those centuries will roll into millennia. People above ground will come and go. Cultures will rise and fall. And all the while, below the surface, that cave full of waste will get smaller and smaller, until the salt caverns swallow up all those oil drums and entombs them. Then, all the old radioactive gloves and tools and little bits from bombs –all still radioactive– will be solidified in the earth&#8217;s crust for more than 200,000 years. Basically forever.<br />
The problem that the aforementioned panel was convened to address was how to convey this information to people 10,000 years in the future, when language and symbols may be so different as to make direct communication impossible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About ten miles north of Concord, New Hampshire, off of interstate 93 there’s a little island with a great, big monument on it. The monument depicts a woman, who is holding a hatchet in her right hand and bunch of scalps in her left hand. When it was erected in 1874, this was the first statue to honor a woman in the United States. But despite this historic status, the monument is controversial because of the woman it memorializes and what she did. The woman in the monument is Hannah Duston and in 1697 she was living in Haverhill, Massachusetts when she, her infant daughter and her nurse-maid, Mary Neff were kidnapped by a band of Abenaki Native Americans. The three were marched north and at some point Hannah’s infant daughter was killed by the Abenakis. They stopped for the night in Boscawen, New Hampshire (on the island above with the monument) and while the Abenaki families slept, Hannah and her companions killed ten of them – including six children – and then scalped each victim before making their escape back to Haverhill.</p>

They stopped for the night in Boscawen, New Hampshire (on the island above with the monument) and while the Abenaki families slept, Hannah and her companions killed ten of them – including six children – and then scalped each victim before making their escape back to Haverhill.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve wandered around Machu Picchu, or Stonehenge, or the Colosseum, or even snuck into that abandoned house on the edge of town, you know the power in a piece of decrepit architecture. And even if you don&#8217;t want to leave your house, the internet is littered with evidence of the human love affair with all things abandoned.<br />
People flock to remainders of ancient civilizations, but people also flock to things that just look like they’re ancient. The combination of decomposition and romance makes a perfect cocktail of repulsion and allure. And for San Franciscans, this place is Sutro Baths.<br />
At the northwestern edge of San Francisco, right on the Pacific Ocean, is a curious jumble of concrete ruins. You wouldn&#8217;t know just looking at it, but this ruin is quite young. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s left of Sutro Baths, a palatial indoor swimming pool and amusement park built in 1898.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uniforms matter. When it comes to sports, they might be the only thing to which we&#8217;re actually loyal.<br />
Sports uniforms are packaging. But unlike any other packaging, if the product inside changes or degrades, we remain loyal. Players come and go, but change the uniform, and you&#8217;ll hear about it.<br />
There are very few ways for players to put their own personal style into their uniforms. In baseball, in the face of huge opposition from curved-brim loyalists, some players take the bold stance of wearing a straight brim, like George Sherrill who is nick-named &#8220;The Brim Reaper&#8221; for his flat-brimmed style.<br />
But for people who really geek out about baseball uniforms (like Paul Lukas from Uni Watch) the space below the knee may be the most interesting. It is here that players have the most choices, can make the biggest statement, and be, in the words of Lukas, masters of the &#8220;uni-verse.&#8221;<br />
Most players today choose to wear their pants long, but if you truly want to honor baseball&#8217;s hosiery heritage, you should wear your pants up over your calves and a sharp pair of stirrups.</p>
<p>Paul Lukas of Uni Watch (and creator of the zine Beer Frame, to which 99% Invisible owes a considerable debt) talked with Jesse Thorn, host of the NPR show Bullseye, owner of Maximumfun.org, and life-long SF Giants fans, even though it&#8217;s really hard to wear the cap out because black and orange doesn&#8217;t go with anything.</p>

According to LeMessurier, in 1978 he got a phone call from an undergraduate architecture student making a bold claim about LeMessurier&#8217;s building. He told LeMessurier that Citicorp Center could blow over in the wind.</p>

<p>The quatrefoil has been re-interpreted and re-contextualized in a phenomenon called &#8220;iconographical drift.” The associations with the shape are constantly shifting depending on where it’s used, who is using it, and the purpose for which it is used.</p>
<p>But no matter where it’s turns up, it always implies the same thing: fanciness.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Quatrefoil is the name of the four-lobed cloverleaf shape. It's everywhere: adorning Gothic cathedrals, more modern churches, Rhode Island mansions, mission-style roofs in California, and decorating victorian homes from coast to coast. It's embroidered on bedding, plastered on wallpaper, and patterned on public garbage cans.

The quatrefoil has been re-interpreted and re-contextualized in a phenomenon called "iconographical drift.” The associations with the shape are constantly shifting depending on where it’s used, who is using it, and the purpose for which it is used.

But no matter where it’s turns up, it always implies the same thing: fanciness.</itunes:summary>

<p>Pittsburgh-based comedian Tom Muisal does a bit about a GPS unit that can give directions in &#8220;Pittsburghese.&#8221; Because in Pittsburgh, no one calls it &#8220;Interstate 376,&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;The Parkway.&#8221; It&#8217;s not &#8220;The Liberty Tunnel,&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;The Liberty Tubes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And directions are often given by way of what used to be there.</p>
<p>One day Tom was trying this routine out on his friend, Mike Neilson. Mike is not from Pittsburgh&#8211;he grew up on the other side of the state. When he moved to the Steel City, he had a hard time figuring out how to get around. Because Pittsburghers are always telling him to turn left at something that isn&#8217;t there anymore.</p>
<p>And then, as Mike was listening to Tom&#8217;s Pittsburgher GPS routine, he noticed that in in one iteration of the joke he said, &#8220;turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut.&#8221;</p>
<p>This resonated with Mike. He realized that, because the architecture of a Pizza Hut is so distinctive, he could easily identify any building that used to be a Pizza Hut. The former Pizza Hut was thus a beacon of light shining through a thick fog of impossible directions. Here, in his friend&#8217;s comedy routine, was the one Pittsburghese direction he could give that anyone, regardless of where they&#8217;re from, could comprehend: turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut.</p>
<p>And from there, Mike created a global atlas of all the places that used to be Pizza Huts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 28, 1945, an airplane crashed into the Empire State Building. A B-25 bomber was flying a routine mission, chartering servicemen from Massachusetts to New York City.</p>
<p>Capt. William F. Smith, who had led some of the most dangerous missions in World War II in the European theatre, was the pilot. The day was foggy. Smith called LaGuardia Airport and requested a clearance to land. With nearly zero visibility, the tower suggested that Smith stay in the air. He ignored air traffic control and started a descent that took him over midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>Just as he straightened out, the clouds broke up enough for him to realize he was flying among skyscrapers.</p>
<p>The bomber crashed into the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world at the time. The collision killed Smith, two others on the plane, and eleven people who worked inside the building.</p>
<p>When the plane hit, parts of the engine flew ahead and severed the lifting cables of two elevators on the 79th floor. The elevators crashed to the sub-basement. In one of the elevators was a 19-year-old elevator operator named Betty Lou Oliver. She broke her pelvis, back and neck — but she survived.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elevators are old. They would have to be. Because it is in our nature to rise.</p>
<p>History is full of things that lift other things. In ancient Greece, and China, and Hungary, there were systems of weights and pulleys and platforms designed to bring nobility&#8211;or their meals&#8211;to new heights.</p>
<p>And somewhere below were draft animals, or even people, tasked with turning a wheel to bring these early elevators up and down. One man even spent the year of 1743 in a chimney in order to turn a lever to raise King Louis XV on a platform so the king wouldn&#8217;t have to walk up a single flight of stairs.</p>
<p>These elevators were dangerous. Ropes would snap, and then anything getting raised or lowered would plummet to the ground. Fall one story and you break your leg&#8211;fall two stories you break your neck. And this fear of falling kept building heights low. People only wanted to ascend as high as they could walk. The tallest buildings for most of the 19th century were churches, or lighthouses&#8211;buildings made up primarily of empty space.</p>
<p>And then came Elisha Otis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you tune around on a shortwave radio, you might stumble across a voice reciting an endless stream of numbers. Just numbers, all day, everyday. These so-called &#8220;numbers stations,&#8221; say nothing about where they are transmitting from or who they are trying to reach, but they can be heard in Spanish, Thai, German, Russian, Chinese, and any number of other languages from around the world.</p>
<p>These mysterious shortwave transmissions caught the attention of producer David Goren when he was just a kid. His piece, Atencion! Seis Siete Tres Siete Cero: The Mystery of the Shortwave Numbers Stations, aired in 2000 as part of the series Lost and Found Sound. In tuning into these weird little broadcasts, Goren joins a curious community that has been listening to numbers stations for decades, some suspecting that the stations are run by intelligence agencies sending encrypted messages to individual agents in the field.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cameron Smith is building a space suit in his apartment.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not an astronaut. He&#8217;s not even an engineer. Cameron Smith is an archaeologist&#8211;on faculty in the anthropology department at Portland State University in Oregon. But Cameron is an explorer by nature. He’s been diving in Puget Sound, survived arctic winters in Iceland and Alaska and summited Oregon’s Mount Hood more times than he can count.</p>
<p>Now he wants to take on outer space. And since Cameron doesn&#8217;t have an entire space program behind him, that means doing it on the cheap. His homemade space suite costs $2,000. A standard issue suit from NASA runs about $12 million.</p>
<p>The space suit has been a 3 years in the making. Eventually, Cameron will put on the suit and step into a gondola and a balloon (also homemade) will take him up 50,000 feet in the air. At that point, he&#8217;ll be depending on his own craftiness to keep himself alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love those moments when you’re walking in your neighborhood and suddenly nothing is familiar. In a good way.</p>
<p>Sean Cole began seeing his neighborhood, actually the whole city of New York, with new eyes because of one artist who is trying to do nothing less than draw all the buildings in New York.</p>

		<itunes:summary>I love those moments when you’re walking in your neighborhood and suddenly nothing is familiar. In a good way.

Sean Cole began seeing his neighborhood, actually the whole city of New York, with new eyes because of one artist who is trying to do nothing less than draw all the buildings in New York.

James Gulliver Hancock’s drawings are intricate, but still a little cartoony. Little squiggles and dots hover above the roofs, as though they’re saying “look out!” or maybe “ta-da!”

<p>If you were a movie star in the market for a mansion in 1930s Los Angeles, there was a good chance you might call on Wallace Neff.</p>
<p>Neff wasn&#8217;t just an architect&#8211;he was a starchitect. One of his most famous projects was the renovation of Pickfair, the estate owned by the iconic silent film actress Mary Pickford, and her husband Douglas Fairbanks. When the couple moved into Pickfar, the house sat on a nameless street in an empty neighborhood called Beverly Hills. If you were lucky enough to be invited to dinner at Pickfair you might find yourself seated next to Babe Ruth, the King of Spain or Albert Einstein. Life magazine called Pickfair “only slightly less important than the white house, and much more fun.” Neff designed estates for Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland and Groucho Marx. His Libby Ranch is now owned by Reese Witherspoon.</p>
<p>But at the end of his life, Wallace Neff lived in a 1,000 square foot concrete bubble. And Neff believed that this simple dome was his greatest architectural achievements.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based reporter David Weinberg spoke with historian Jeffrey Head, author of No Nails, No Lumber: The Bubble Houses of Wallace Neff. David also spoke with Kathy Miles, who grew up in Igloo Village; Steve Roden, an artist and current resident of the last remaining bubble house in the US; and architect Stefanos Polyzoides, who has his practice in a classic Spanish/Mediterranean-style Wallace Neff building.</p>
<p>We also hear from Dakar-based producer Juliana Friend, who was nice enough to go check on the bubbles over there.</p>
<p>A different version of this story originally aired on KCRW as part of their Independent Producer Project.</p>
<p>David Weinberg is also the brains behind Random Tape, an audio experiment in, well, random tape.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers have an ethics code. Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA):</p>
<p>&#8220;Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights.</p>
<p>Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, &#8220;segregation&#8221;). The latter kind of prison is called a &#8220;supermax,&#8221; or &#8220;security housing unit&#8221; (SHU).

		<itunes:summary>Lawyers have an ethics code. Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA):

"Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors."

A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights.

Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, "segregation"). The latter kind of prison is called a "supermax," or "security housing unit" (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it's up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement.

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay.

Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It's not a space that's designed to keep you comfortable. But it's not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the ancient Greeks, sirens were mythical creatures who sang out to passing sailors from rocks in the sea. Their music was so beautiful, it was said, that the sailors were powerless against it&#8211;they would turn their ships towards these sea nymphs and crash in the impassable reefs around them.</p>
<p>In Homer&#8217;s Odyssey, there&#8217;s a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit. Odysseus knows that if he hears the siren&#8217;s song, his ship is going to sink. But he still wants to hear what they sound like. So he comes up with a plan: Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast of his ship so that he can&#8217;t give commands. And then Odysseus has his men fill their own ears with beeswax so they can&#8217;t hear anything. They set sail in striking distance of the sirens&#8217; call. The plan works: Odysseus gets to hear the music, his men don&#8217;t, and they sail on to safety&#8211;with Odysseus pleading with his crew to crash the boat the whole way.</p>
<p>And for the next 2000 or so years, that&#8217;s what a siren was: a creature that makes a beautiful sound.</p>
<p>But that all changed in 1819, when a French engineer named Charles Cagniard de la Tour decided to call the artificial noisemaker he was working on&#8211;the siren.</p>
<p>And this new, mechanical siren became one of THE signature sounds of the turn of the Century. Sirens warned people about immanent bombing raids during World War I. Sirens announced incoming fire engines, and ambulances, and police.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to the siren, the world of the the early 20th Century had become a lot louder than any time in human history. And we can probably assume that these sirens that people heard in cities all over the world&#8211;sounded NOTHING like the siren songs of Greek myth.</p>
<p>At least to most. One man, a composer, named Arseny Avraamov heard music in the cacophony of the modern world. And he tried to create a composition&#8211;a symphony&#8211; from the clatter of the newly formed Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Moscow-based producer Charles Maynes investigated the legend of Avraamov and his forgotten masterpiece. This is The Symphony of Sirens, Revisited.</p>
<p>This story was part of the Global Story Project, presented by PRX with support from the Open Society Foundations.</p>
<p>Plus, we hear a rebroadcast of &#8220;The Unsung Icons of Soviet Design.&#8221; (episode #25)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans have always had an uneasy relationship with gambling. To circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US, early slot machines masqueraded as vending machines. They gave out chewing gum as prizes, and those prizes could be redeemed for cash.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called &#8220;fruit machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895.</p>
<p>To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine&#8217;s wheels in motion. The slot machine&#8217;s crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the &#8220;one-armed bandit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as &#8220;legacy levers,&#8221; because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated&#8211;from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave.</p>
<p>At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture&#8211;both figuratively and literally. The real money was in tabletop games&#8211;or so it was thought&#8211;and the slots were set up around the edges of the casino to give gamblers&#8217; wives something to do while they waited.</p>
<p>But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin. A penny slot machine could let you place a hundred different one-cent bets per spin&#8211;so even if you win 40 cents on one line, and the machine congratulates you with flashing lights and chimes, you still lose 60 cents.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how video slots have become the most lucrative&#8211;and addictive&#8211;game in a casino.</p>
<p>Our guest this week is Natasha Dow Schüll, an MIT-based anthropologist who has been studying Las Vegas and the culture of gambling for more than fifteen years. Schüll is the author of Addiction by Design.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of how you feel about basketball, you’ve got to appreciate the way it can bring groups of strangers together to share moments of pure adulation and collective defeat.</p>
<p>That moment when time is running out, the team is down by one, a player arcs the ball from downtown just as the buzzer sounds—and sinks it. It’s exhilarating. It’s heart breaking. And most of all, it’s good design. But it’s not the way basketball was originally designed.</p>
<p>During pro basketball’s infancy in the 1950s, nothing forced a player to shoot the ball. If a team was winning, and they wanted to keep their lead, the team could literally hold on to the ball for ten minutes and run the clock out.</p>
<p>But in 1954, Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone had crunched some numbers, and he believed that some simple arithmetic could save basketball.</p>
<p>Reporter Eric Mennel, from the radio show BackStory with the American History Guys, spoke with Dolph Schayes—who played on the Syracuse Nationals both before and after the advent of the shot clock—about how Biasone’s contribution to the game shaped basketball into what it has become today.</p>

<p>The large number of hidden public staircases is part of what makes California so great. Charles Fleming is one of the world experts of coastal California&#8217;s public stairs. He has documented and mapped walking routes through nearly every useable public staircase in San Francisco&#8217;s East Bay, as well as in Los Angeles (where he lives). Charles published his findings in two walking guides, appropriately titled Secret Stairs.</p>

<p>There comes a time in the life of a modern city where it begins to grow up&#8211;literally. Santiago, the capital of Chile, has been going through a tremendous growth spurt since its economic boom of the mid 1990s. It happened fast. In just a few years, single family homes all over the city were replaced with high rises.</p>
<p>A man named Rodrigo Rojas played a small part in Santiago’s &#8220;upward mobility&#8221;&#8211;which wouldn’t be that remarkable if he were an engineer, a real estate developer, or an architect. But Rodrigo Rojas is a poet.</p>
<p>This is how it worked: A developer bought an old house, tore it down, and had an architect draw up plans for a high rise. And then Rodrigo stepped in to give the building a name. Rodrigo even fabricated whole stories in the service of building an identity. He came up with one story about a ship called the Zanzibar, a luxury liner built with the Titanic, but slightly smaller. You&#8217;ve never heard of it, he explained, because the Zanzibar never sank.</p>
<p>Our reporter this week is Daniel Alarcón, host and executive producer of Radio Ambulante.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many cities in Central Europe, Warsaw is made up largely of grey, ugly, communist block-style architecture. Except for one part: The Old Town.<br />
Walking through this historic district, it’s just like any other quaint European city. There are tourist shops, horse-drawn carriage rides, church spires. The buildings are beautiful&#8211;but they are not original.<br />
During World War II, Nazi forces razed more than 80% of Warsaw. After Soviet troops took over, much of the city was rebuilt in the with communist style: fast, cheap, and big. They built apartment blocks, wide avenues, and heavy grey buildings. It was communist ideology in architectural form.<br />
But when it came to the historic district of Warsaw&#8211; the Old Town and a long connecting section called the Royal Route&#8211;they decided not just to rebuild, but to restore. Builders would use the same stones, and use special kilns to make special bricks to preserve its authenticity. After six years of reconstruction, the new Old Town was opened. Poles were ecstatic to have it back. Even in the West, it was seen as a triumph of the human spirit.<br />
But here&#8217;s the thing: Warsaw’s historic Old Town is not a replica of the original. It’s a re-imagining. An historic city that never really was.<br />
Reporters and producers Amy Drozdowska and Dave McGuire talk with social anthropologist Michael Murawski about the fake recreation of Old Town and what it means to modern Warsaw.</p>

<p>When Eric Molinsky lived in Los Angeles, he kept hearing this story about a bygone transportation system called the Red Car. The Red Car, he was told, had been this amazing network of streetcars that connected the city&#8211;until a car company bought it, dismantled it, and forced a dependency on freeways.</p>
<p>But like most legends, the one that Eric heard about the Red Car is not entirely accurate. It&#8217;s true that Los Angeles did have an extensive mass transit system called the Red Car, which at one time ran on 1,100 miles of track&#8211;about 25 percent more more track mileage than New York City has today, a century later.</p>
<p>But the Red Car wasn&#8217;t the victim of a conspiracy. The Red Car WAS the conspiracy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Melissa Lee was growing up in Hastings-on-Hudson, a small town in upstate New York, there were only so many fun things to do. One was buying geodes and smashing them apart with a hammer. (You know geodes, right? Those dull-looking brown rocks that you break open to reveal crystalline structures inside?)</p>
<p>One day, when Melissa was thirteen, she and her friend Liz bought some geodes. They didn&#8217;t want to wait to get home to crack them open, so they decided to throw them against the wall of an apartment building. Liz&#8217;s aim went wild, and the geode went through a window.</p>
<p>Melissa and Liz tried to find person whose window they had broken, but they couldn&#8217;t figure out which door in the apartment building lead to the unit with the window in question. Eventually they gave up.</p>
<p>Melissa would have probably forgotten about the incident had it not been for one inexplicable thing: the window didn&#8217;t get fixed. Ever.</p>
<p>It was clear that someone lived there. Melissa would walk by the window and see the apartment lit up by a TV. Someone was opening the window in the summer, and closing it in the winter. But the hole remained.</p>
<p>Melissa finished middle school, then high school, then went away to college. And when she came home and saw the window still broken, it had this effect of making her feel like the nervous, insecure thirteen year old she was when she broke the window.</p>
<p>This became a pattern for Melissa: she&#8217;d leave home, do some growing up, come home, see the window, and feel like a teenager.</p>
<p>Melissa traveled the world. She went to graduate school, She moved to Washington, DC, She got married. And every time she&#8217;d come home, she&#8217;d see the window. &#8220;As much as I was changing, this part of my past was completely frozen,&#8221; Melissa says. &#8220;As soon as I saw the window I was brought right back to those middle school days when we had broken it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in 2011, 22 years after the incident, Melissa went to go find the person who left the window broken for so long. She brought along a tape recorder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kowloon Walled City was the densest place in the world, ever.</p>
<p>By its peak in the 1990s, the 6.5 acre Kowloon Walled City was home to at least 33,000 people (with estimates of up to 50,000). That&#8217;s a population density of at least 3.2 million per square mile. For New York City to get that dense, every man, woman, and child living in Texas would have to move to Manhattan.</p>
<p>To put it another way, think about living in a 1,200 square foot home. Then imagine yourself living with 9 other people. Then imagine that your building is only one unit of a twelve-story building, and every other unit is as full as yours. Then imagine hundreds those buildings crammed together in a space the size of four football fields.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t really imagine it, either.</p>
<p>Kowloon Walled City began as a military fort in Kowloon, a region in mainland China. In 1898, China signed a land lease with Great Britain, giving the British control of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other nearby territories. But the lease stipulated that the fort in Kowloon would remain under Chinese jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Over time, the fort became abandoned, leaving the area subject to neither Chinese nor British authority. This legal gray zone was attractive to displaced and marginalized people. Thousands of people moved there after the war with Japan broke out. Even more people moved there after the Communist Revolution. It attracted gangsters, drug addicts, sex workers, and refugees. And it also drew a lot of normal people from all over China who saw opportunity there.</p>
<p>They built the city building by building, first blanketing the area of the fort, then building vertically. Buildings were packed together so tightly in the Walled City that the alleys were nearly pitch-black in the day time. Electricity and water were brought in by illegal or informal means.</p>
<p>The Walled City gained a reputation as a sort of den of iniquity&#8211;there were high levels of prostitution, gambling, mafia activity, and, for some reason, rampant unlicensed dentistry.</p>
<p>But an order did emerge. The Walled City had no schools, but there was an informal kindergarten. A resident&#8217;s organization settled disputes. And there was lots of industry: a fishball factory, a noodle factory, metalworking shops, a textile mill. There were stores, restaurants. You could even receive mail in the Walled City.</p>
<p>Kowloon Walled City was torn down in 1993. Today, it&#8217;s a park, and most traces of the city are gone. But the memory of the city lives on. It was featured in the non-verbal film Baraka, plays a cameo role in Bloodsport. It&#8217;s also served as the setting in a number of video games, including most recently Call of Duty: Black Ops</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode was produced by Nick van der Kolk. He spoke with photographer Greg Girard and architect Aaron Tan, who both spent time in the Walled City. Nick also talked to as Brian Douglas, who helped design Call of Duty: Black Ops.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Cape Cod town of Woods Hole, buildings are not usually dome-shaped. Producer Katie Klocksin was pretty surprised when she came across one.</p>
<p>Katie started asking around about the dome.  She found it was built by the late Buckminster Fuller, who called himself a &#8220;comprehensive anticipatory design scientist,&#8221; out to solve the problems confronting &#8220;Starship Earth&#8221; by changing the way we make buildings.  &#8220;Bucky&#8221; Fuller invented and patented the geodesic dome, a spherical structure made from small triangles.  The design is based on a lot of complicated math, but the idea is that by relying on the strength of of the triangle, these buildings could be made from cheaper materials, like plastic and aluminum instead of steel and concrete.</p>
<p>In 1953, Fuller was commissioned to build a dome in Woods Hole by architect (and aspiring restauranteur) Gunnar Peterson.  The dome would become the posh Dome Restaurant.  Diners could gaze through the building&#8217;s triangular windows out on onto the sea.  A zither player named Ruth Welcome entertained guests.</p>
<p>Despite its Utopian aspirations, the building had some structural problems.  The glass windows heated the restaurant up like a greenhouse, so the owner installed fiberglass over most of the dome, blocking the ocean views.  It leaked constantly, and was difficult to maintain.  Even though the Woods Hole dome did not radically change the world, Bucky Fuller would go on to become one of the most influential thinkers in design and architecture of the 20th Century.</p>
<p>Today, the Dome Restaurant lies vacant. A new development project could lead to the dome&#8217;s restoration, but for now, it remains a decaying curiosity, inviting exploration from microphone-wielding out-of-towners.</p>

<p>Andrea spoke with Advance guys John Seaton and Donnie Fowler, who have been directing this very American brand of political theater for years.</p>

<p>In the world before telephone, radio, and email, the tasks of transmitting information and moving material objects were essentially the same challenge.  The way you sent someone a message was pretty much the same process as sending someone a package—you had to send a piece of physical media through the post, or on a ship.</p>
<p>It was really the telegraph that divided <em>telling</em> someone something from far away and  <em>giving</em> someone something from far away.

For many cities, the pneumatic tube was essential in getting these slips of paper to the intended recipient quickly.</p>

<p>First up, <a href="http://www.rte.ie/digitalradio/choice/languagebites.html" target="_blank"><em>Language Bites</em></a> from RTE Choice in Ireland. <em>Language Bites</em> is a series of 1-minute programs exploring the origins of popular phrases in the English language. It’s presented by Colette Kinsella and sound designed by Lochlainn Harte. This episode is about the origin of the word “storey” (or in American English “story”) when used to refer to a level of a building. There are 80 episodes in the series and I just adore them. They are in heavy rotation on the radio stream/station I curate for PRX called <a href="http://publicradioremix.org/" target="_blank">Public Radio Remix</a>.</p>
<p>Our second selection is from Nate Dimeo’s brilliant show, <em><a href="http://thememorypalace.us/" target="_blank">the memory palace</a></em>. Each episode of the memory palace features pointedly short, surprising stories about the past. It’s sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hysterical, and often a wonderful mix of both. It was also a huge inspiration in the creation of 99% Invisible. This episode is about the beautiful sculpture and star map commemorating the Hoover Dam.</p>

<p>He is also a radio producer. One night, drunk and stumbling around the Hudson River with his friend Malissa O’Donnell, he discovered a monument — two of them actually — to two of his poetry heroes. Apropos of the name of this show, the tribute wasn’t very obvious. In fact, he and Malissa nearly walked right past it.

<p>Thus began Sean’s quest to talk to the people whose idea this was — forging a largely unloved art form into a permanent fixture of the cultural landscape. Along the way he talks with urban landscape architect <a href="http://www.mpfp.com/index.shtml" target="_blank">M. Paul Friedberg</a>, former Battery Park official Richard Kahan and none other than Frank O’Hara’s younger sister, Maureen O’Hara.</p>

<p>The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the town’s most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen year old boy in the area had his bar mitzvah there.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood’s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It’s now dilapidated and empty.</p>
<p>But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel.</p>

<p>Gwen Macsai grew up nearby and she always thought it was really, really ugly. Lots of people did. To be fair, <a href="http://www.savethepurple.com/" target="_blank">lots of people didn’t</a>. But everyone has an opinion about it.</p>

But you don’t know where it came from.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goethe said, “Architecture is frozen music.” I like that.</p>
<p>Of course that was before audio recording, so now, for the most part, <em>music</em> is frozen music.</p>
<p>It’s only very recently in the history of music that we’ve been able to freeze music into an object. In my life, the form of this object mattered a lot. I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes, where there were two first songs per album, Side A and Side B. The energy of a first song makes it stand apart, at least in my head it does. Then the CD came along and eliminated Side B and there was only first song, and the actual number of a track (that you see prominently on the UI) became my index for sorting songs. Then MP3s jumbled my sense of track order, and albums began to feel more like a loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual whole. I could name hundreds more examples like these, and I welcome you to chime in, but my point is: the form of the thing matters.</p>
<p>But no effect has been as world changing as that original innovation: freezing music in time onto a recording, where a single version of a song, a single performance of a song, became <em>the song</em>. An inherently mutable method of communication was fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>I heard a radio broadcast several years ago that really affected the way I thought about all this. Jim Derogatis and Greg Kot are the hosts of a radio program I’m a huge fan of called <a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/" target="_blank">Sound Opinions</a> (<a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/podcast_landing.html" target="_blank">subscribe now</a>). The songwriter, composer, and producer,<a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/shownotes/2006/070806/shownotes.html" target="_blank"> Jon Brion came to WBEZ</a> in Chicago to talk to Sound Opinions in 2006. At the time, Brion has just co-produced Kanye West’s album Late Registration and he was also already a renowned film composer. In this interview, Brion talks about the difference between what he calls “performance pieces” and “songs” and how recorded music has changed the way we appreciate the different art forms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a beer nerd, or have a friend who’s a beer nerd, you’ve heard of Belgian beers. Belgians take beer very seriously. Amongst the 200 Belgian breweries, there’s a very specific sub-type: Trappist beers.</p>
<p>According to our reporter Cyrus Farivar (also from <a href="http://soundcloud.com/roman-mars/99-invisible-36-super-bon-bonn" target="_blank">Episode #36 “Super Bonn Bon”</a>), there are two things you need to know about Trappist beers. First, they’re amazing. Second, they’re made by Trappist monks. These monks trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France, and have since spread out to all over the world.</p>
<p>The main concept behind the Trappist lifestyle is that the abbey should be economically self-sufficient. In other words, the monks should make something and sell it to the public as a way to fund the operations of the abbey itself. Some make cheese. Some make spirits. There’s even one in Germany that makes lentil soup. But none of the Trappist products are as famous as the beer.</p>
<p>The beer that is considered the best of the best is <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/313/1545" target="_blank">Westvleteren 12</a>. With its plain brown bottle, no label, the only writing is on the cap- the beer is super cool. It’s quite rare and year after year it’s <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/westvleteren-abdij-st-sixtus/623/" target="_blank">rated the best beer in the world</a>.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing about Westvleteren. You can’t just go there and have as much beer as you want. You can’t even have it shipped from the abbey. If you want to buy beer to take with you, you have to look up the beer reservation phone number on the <a href="http://www.sintsixtus.be/eng/brouwerij.htm" target="_blank">abbey’s website</a>. Then, you call certain phone number during certain hours, on certain days.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to talk to a monk to take your reservation, you have to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate during the appointed time that weekend. You’re limited to one crate per person per car, maximum two per car. And, you can’t buy more than one crate during a 60-day period. You also have to agree not to resell the beer.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times, no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make it as difficult as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidsfonds.be/publisher/author/detail.phtml?id=103" target="_blank">Jef van den Steen</a>, author of a book called <em><a href="http://shop.belgianshop.com/acatalog/buy-online-book-trappist-the-seven-magnificent-beers.html" target="_blank">Trappist: The Seven Heavenly Beers</a> </em>and an <a href="http://www.glazentoren.be/home-eng.htm" target="_blank">acclaimed brewer</a> himself, says that’s not the case, “Before, Westvleteren was only well-known was in Belgium. And now it’s worldwide, and that’s the problem. They decide we will brew the same amount as the last 40-50 years, and they have enough for that, so why must they brew more? Because you want? No. They live between the walls of the abbey, so for them it’s not a problem.”</p>
<p>The “customer service” is not designed to provide convenience for the consumer of their beer, it is designed for monks themselves. Their “customer” is God, so to speak. They have a mission, and making beer is only a fraction of that. The Head of the Abbey says, “We are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cyrusfarivar.com" target="_blank">Cyrus Farivar</a> recently returned to California after having lived in Bonn, Germany for two years. These days, he can be found frequenting <a href="http://thetrappist.com/" target="_blank">The Trappist</a> bar in downtown Oakland. He plans on presenting a bottle of Westvleteren 12 to his favorite bar owners. His book, <a href="http://www.internetofelsewhere.com" target="_blank"><em>The Internet of Elsewhere</em></a>, was published last year.</p>

This sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times, no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make it as difficult as possible.

Jef van den Steen, author of a book called Trappist: The Seven Heavenly Beers and an acclaimed brewer himself, says that’s not the case, “Before, Westvleteren was only well-known was in Belgium. And now it’s worldwide, and that’s the problem. They decide we will brew the same amount as the last 40-50 years, and they have enough for that, so why must they brew more? Because you want? No. They live between the walls of the abbey, so for them it’s not a problem.”

The “customer service” is not designed to provide convenience for the consumer of their beer, it is designed for monks themselves. Their “customer” is God, so to speak. They have a mission, and making beer is only a fraction of that. The Head of the Abbey says, “We are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks.”

Cyrus Farivar recently returned to California after having lived in Bonn, Germany for two years. These days, he can be found frequenting The Trappist bar in downtown Oakland. He plans on presenting a bottle of Westvleteren 12 to his favorite bar owners. His book, The Internet of Elsewhere, was published last year.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happens when we build big?</p>
<p>Julia Barton remembers going to the top floor of Dallas’s then-new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_City_Hall" target="_blank">city hall</a> when she was teenager. The building, designed by I.M. Pei, is a huge trapezoid jutting out over a wide plaza. Julia found the view from the top pretty fantastic, especially when munching on a Caramello bar from the City Hall vending machines.</p>
<p>But once she went to a protest in the plaza below. And those same windows, now hulking over her, made her feel small, and the whole event insignificant. Texans have a fondness for big structures—big <a href="http://stadium.dallascowboys.com/" target="_blank">arenas</a>, big <a href="http://southfork.com/" target="_blank">houses</a>, big <a href="http://www.texasfreeway.com/dallas/photos/north_dallas_aerial/north_dallas_aerial.shtml" target="_blank">freeways</a>. Julia wasn’t sure if their hidden message wasn’t simply this: I’m important, you’re nobody.</p>
<p>For people who distrust the big project, Edward Tenner’s 2001 essay “<a href="http://www.edwardtenner.com/the_xanadu_effect_21105.htm" target="_blank">The Xanadu Effect</a>” is some comfort. Tenner, a visiting scholar at Princeton University, ponders the ways in which obsession with bigness can presage hard times for a business or even a nation. Tenner named his essay not for Olivia Newton-John’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiCYeaMJdEQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">anthem</a> or even the Coleridge <a href="http://www.poetry-online.org/coleridge_kubla_khan.htm" target="_blank">poem</a>, but for the palace <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_%28Citizen_Kane%29" target="_blank">Xanadu</a> built in the movie “Citizen Kane.” That Xanadu, of course, was based on a real-life palace that newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst built in his waning days of empire:</p>
<blockquote><p>On its 24,000 acres were a 354,000-gallon swimming pool, a private zoo and four main buildings with a total of 165 rooms. Along with other such extravagances, the estate helped send Hearst into trusteeship late in life. The cavernous halls of Welles’ gloomy cinematic Xanadu seemed to filmgoers — as the real, happier building must have appeared to many Hearst Corp. public investors — the very image of the pride that goes before a fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>The downside of the Xanadu Effect has seen itself play out in other places—the Empire State Building, for example, was conceived in the 1920s but completed during the Great Depression, when it was known as “the Empty State Building.” Tenner’s not arguing that big things shouldn’t be built; he’s saying bigness is a gamble. It pays off when it it uplifts people, gives them a sense of grandeur and purpose. It fails when it crushes them or just makes life a pain, as in the big-built city of Moscow, where pedestrians have to scurry under the wide avenues in tunnels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a recent reporting trip to Russia for <a href="http://www.theworld.org/" target="_blank">PRI’s “The World</a>,” Julia travelled to Sochi, Russia’s southern-most city and upcoming host of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Sochi is Europe’s biggest construction site right now, with Xanadu-like ice-palaces going up right on the Black Sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the construction—including billions of dollars of infrastructure—is good news for the Russian state and shoring up its presence in the Caucasus. It’s not necessarily good news for the locals. Julia interviewed a Sochi resident, Alexei Kravets, who’s been in a stand-off with authorities about the fate of the home he built by the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Kravets’s court case to save his home has been standing in the way of a new railway complex. Construction workers have been throwing rocks through his windows, scraping his walls with backhoes, and hauling away his storage units. Kravets has been confronting them on film.</p>
<p>It’s a dramatic example of big vs. small, but this type of conflict often happens in the face of massive development. Edward Tenner says beyond just governments or private developers, we all need to think more carefully about the costs and benefits of building big.</p>
<p>“Bigness is a strategy that just about always fails, unless it succeeds. Or you could say it always succeeds except when it fails. And there really is no one way that you can regard it. You have to see it as a very powerful, easy-to-misuse, but also tempting way to go about things in life,” he says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the deck would go up and down by several feet with the slightest breeze. Construction workers on the span chewed on lemon wedges to stop their motion sickness. They nicknamed the structure Galloping Gertie.</p>
<p>The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge design by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for a suspension bridge, but it was later modified by Leon Moisseiff to be slimmer and more elegant. The most notable change was that the 25 foot lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings, were replaced with 8 foot solid steel plate girders. The new solid girder along the side in Moisseiff’s design made for a much lighter and more flexible bridge— it also caught the wind like a sail— but they didn’t know that. Moisseiff’s design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design and that fact ultimately won the day.</p>
<p>Motorists who used the bridge found out first hand why it got the name Galloping Gertie, and during the four months while the bridge was open, many traveled from far away just to ride the undulating waves as they crossed high above Puget Sound. The thrill ride didn’t last long.</p>
<p>On November 7, 1940 stiff winds caused the road deck to twist violently along its center axis. The center span endured these brutal torsional forces for about an hour and finally gave way.</p>
<p>The collapse of the twisting suspension bridge is one of the most dramatic images caught on film.</p>
<p>I talked to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/john.marr1" target="_blank">John Marr</a> from the seminal zine <a href="http://mcbflibrary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Murder Can Be Fun</a> for this story and I’d like to give a shout out to Alan Bellows of <a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/" target="_blank">Damn Interesting</a> for independently suggesting Galloping Gertie as a show topic and publishing a great, <a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/the-fall-of-galloping-gertie/" target="_blank">much more detailed account of the disaster on his site</a>.</p>

<p>Cities are great. They have movement, activity and diversity. But go to any city and it’s pretty clear, a place can be diverse without really being integrated. This segregation isn’t accidental. There are design elements in the urban landscape, that Daniel D’Oca calls “weapons,” that are used by “architects, planners, policy-makers, developers, real estate brokers, community activists, neighborhood associations, and individuals to wage the ongoing war between integration and segregation.”</p>
<p>Daniel D’Oca is an urban planner with Interboro Partners, an architecture and design firm based in New York City. Over the past few years, D’Oca, along with colleagues <a href="http://www.interboropartners.net/partners/" target="_blank">Tobias Armborst and Georgeen Theodore</a> have been cataloging all the stuff inside of a city that planners use to increase or restrict people’s access to space.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The acoustics of a building are a big concern for architects. But for designers at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, it’s the absence of sound that defines the approach to architecture.</p>
<p>Gallaudet is a university dedicated to educating the deaf and hard of hearing, and since 2005, they’ve re-thought principles of architecture with one question at the forefront: how do deaf people communicate in space?</p>
<p>Unlike hearing people, the deaf have to keep sightlines in order to maintain conversations. So when deaf people walk and talk, they’ll lock into a kind of dance.

		<itunes:summary>The acoustics of a building are a big concern for architects. But for designers at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, it’s the absence of sound that defines the approach to architecture.

Gallaudet is a university dedicated to educating the deaf and hard of hearing, and since 2005, they’ve re-thought principles of architecture with one question at the forefront: how do deaf people communicate in space?

Unlike hearing people, the deaf have to keep sightlines in order to maintain conversations. So when deaf people walk and talk, they’ll lock into a kind of dance. Going through a doorway, one person will spin in place and walk backwards to keep talking. Walking past a column, two deaf people in conversation will move in tandem to avoid collision.

Spaces designed for the hearing can also give the deaf a great deal of anxiety – when you can’t hear footsteps from around the corner or behind you, you can’t anticipate who or what is around you.

Robert Sirvage is a deaf designer, researcher, and instructor at Gallaudet, and in collaboration with Hansel Bauman — who is not deaf – and a group of staff, students and architects, they’ve developed a project called DeafSpace. Reporter Tom Dreisbach took a tour through the new building at Gallaudet that is incorporating the innovations of DeafSpace to create an environment more pleasing to everyone, both hearing and deaf.</itunes:summary>

<blockquote><p>“I have this habit of walking into any door that’s unlocked…You start poking around, going into doors…you find the coolest things…”<br />
-Andrea Seabrook, NPR Congressional Correspondent</p></blockquote>
<p>In the eight years Andrea Seabrook has been reporting on Congress, she has made it a point to get to know the whole Capitol building. “The members of the House Republican Caucus–and sometimes the Democrats–meet in the basement for their closed door secret strategy sessions,” Andrea says. “And it’s really good place to get a tip from members that you know about what’s going on.” One day, after getting the info she needed for her story, she decided to press further on into the depths of the Capitol.</p>
<p>That’s when she found the marble bathtubs.</p>
<p>The bathtubs were installed around 1860 during the expansion of the Capitol. DC is known for its swampy summers, and legend has it that senators could be banished from the chamber if they were too smelly. But lawmakers–like most Americans at the time–didn’t have indoor plumbing at home. They needed a place where they could wash up.</p>
<p>So the Architect of the Capitol ordered six marble bath tubs, each three by seven feet and carved by hand in Italy, to be installed in the Capitol basement–three on the House side, three on the senate. Today, only two tubs remain on the Senate side, in a room which now stores the building’s heating and cooling equipment. But evidence of room’s former grandeur remains.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before the 1850s, dentures were made out of very hard, very painful and very expensive material, like gold or ivory. They were a luxury item. The invention of Vulcanite hard rubber changed everything. It was moldable, it could be precisely fitted, and it was relatively cheap. Everyone began making dentures with Vulcanite bases. But in 1864, a long disputed patent application, originally filed in 1852, was awarded and then acquired by the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. It was an outfit created to collect fees, or very often, sue dentists who already used vulcanite, and there were plenty of dentists to go after.</p>
<p>The person in charge of pursuing the violators was Josiah Bacon, the treasurer of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. The patent was enforced with extreme prejudice, despite the protestations of the US dental profession.</p>
<p>To quote the secretary of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, Ernest Caduc: “Many dentists…relying upon the secret nature of the business, prefer to steal this property rather than buy it…”</p>
<p>It all came to a head on Easter Sunday in 1879. A Vulcanite denture patent violating dentist named Samuel Chalfant went to settle his business with his pursuer, Josiah Bacon, in his San Francisco hotel room. Chalfant brought a gun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.beautypill.com/" target="_blank">Beauty Pill</a> is band I <em>really</em> like from Washington DC. They have released two EPs (<a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/128-5/cigarette-girl-from-the-future" target="_blank"><em>The Cigarette Girl From the Future</em></a> and <a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/138/you-are-right-to-be-afraid" target="_blank"><em>You Are Right to be Afraid</em></a>) and their last album, <a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/139/the-unsustainable-lifestyle" target="_blank"><em>The Unsustainable Lifestyle</em></a>, came out in 2004.</p>
<p>In the interim, the singer/guitarist/producer for Beauty Pill, Chad Clark, got very sick and nearly died. That can be enough to make anyone stop making music, but in Clark’s case, he continued to make music, but he just never felt the need to release a record or play live. His music was just for him and his friends, and that was OK.</p>
<p>But a strange confluence of opportunity, desire and architecture knocked Beauty Pill out of their unforced exile. The curators at a new multimedia art center called <a href="http://artisphere.com/calendar/event-details/Visual-Arts/IMMERSIVE-IDEAL.aspx" target="_blank">Artisphere</a> invited Chad Clark to come in and do something musical in the space. While they were showing him around, he saw the angled, 2nd floor window overlooking the Black Box Theater and it reminded him of the window in <a href="http://www.abbeyroad.com/Studio/6/Studio-Two" target="_blank">Abbey Road Studio 2</a>, made famous by The Beatles. Months later, the Black Box Theater was transformed into a very public recording studio, capturing the sounds and energy of the band, onlookers and guests over the course of a couple weeks.</p>

<p>-Chris Richards, “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011403291.html" target="_blank">Move along with the soundtrack of Metro’s screechy, wailing escalators</a>” The Washington Post, 01/14/11</p></blockquote>
<p>Ever since the industrial revolution, when it became possible for products to be designed just once and then mass produced, it has been the slight imperfections and wear introduced by human use that has transformed a quality mass produced product into a thing we love. Your worn blue jeans, your grandmothers iron skillet, the initial design determined their quality, but it’s their imperfections that make them comfortable, that make them lovable, that make them yours.</p>
<p>And if you think that a “slightly broken” escalator can’t be lovable, then our own Sam Greenspan would like to introduce you to Chris Richards. Chris Richards is a music critic for the Washington Post, and after years of ignoring the wailing and screeching of the much maligned, often broken escalators in the DC Metro, he began to hear them in a new way. He began to hear them as music.</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to get overwhelmed and frustrated by all the human-object interactions in the modern world. I’ve never used a “coin return” button on a vending machine that worked and there is interesting criticism of the increasingly common “<a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/" target="_blank">pictures under glass</a>” type of interface on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>But as Paola Antonelli explains to producer Benjamen Walker (from <a href="http://tmi.wfmu.org/" target="_blank">Too Much Information</a>), the evolution of communication design is pointing to a world that minimizes human-object interfaces and leaves us to free to focus on real human habits and needs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United Nations Plaza sits in the center of San Francisco. Most people consider it a complete failure as a public space. Its central feature, at the entrance of the plaza, is a unique fountain that was designed by Lawrence Halprin in 1975. The water shoots out at various angles, from inside a sunken pit, filled with large granite slabs. It’s a design that kind of pulls you in and invites you to take the steps down to the water and climb in between the hulking stones. And that’s part of the problem.</p>
<p>In 2004, radio producer <a href="http://www.temchine.com/" target="_blank">Ben Temchine</a>, created a really fantastic documentary of UN Plaza, called “The Biography of 100,000 Square Feet” that first aired on my first radio program called <em>Invisible Ink</em> in May of 2004. (Yep another “invisible” show) The documentary really takes a hard look at UN Plaza when it was really at its worst and asks the question, is there a point where the good intentions and idealism of a design become so removed from reality, that it actually borders on negligence?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to imagine a place where more desperate and depressing drama unfolds on a daily basis than a family courthouse- custody battles, abuse, divorce- and if you were to design a place to reflect and amplify that misery, not mitigate it, it’d probably take the form of the old New York County Family Courthouse in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p>The original shiny black cube, built in 1975, was referred to as the “Darth Vader building” by court employees (presumably after 1977).

		<itunes:summary>It’s hard to imagine a place where more desperate and depressing drama unfolds on a daily basis than a family courthouse- custody battles, abuse, divorce- and if you were to design a place to reflect and amplify that misery, not mitigate it, it’d probably take the form of the old New York County Family Courthouse in Lower Manhattan.
